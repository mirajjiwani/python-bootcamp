# Working with Files
# Open a file
# Two Possible Errors

# Must pass file name
myfile = open() 
# Missing directory declaration
myfile = open('wrong.txt') # Wrong File Path

# Open = Set variable to the file text
myfile = open('/Users/mirajsali/Miraj/Develop/Cloud/Python Bootcamp/Files/testfile.txt')  # Pass full file path if needed
myfile.read() # Read file that was opened - Rerunning this will come up blank. Cursor moves to end after being run.

myfile.seek(0) # Reset Cursor to beginning of file
myfile.read() # Shows string from file after reset

contents = myfile.read()
contents

myfile.readlines() # Grab a list. Each line becomes an item or element in List
