# Variable Rules
# No start with number, no special characters, lowercase

# Dynamic Typing - Easy to use, could result in bugs (Use type() to be sure of data types)

a = 5
a
a = 10
a + a

# Keep running again (cell environment), it'll run again
a = a + a
a

# Understand Type of variable and resassign type
type(a) # Should be int
a = 30.1
type(a) # Should be float

# Using Names in Variables
